Purpose:

This project aims to leverage Pandas to showcase the impact data of fires in the Southern California region. 
Beyond the physical land burned from the fires, I want to visualize economic data, and showcase the economic loss suffered 
as a consequence of these fires. I also want to simulate what economic data might have looked like if these fires had never occurred in the first place. 
I want to take many sources of data into consideration for this and shine a spotlight onto the smaller communities that were neglected 
from national coverage in the wake of these events, so that in visualizing important data such as this, we can educate others with
easy to grasp visualizations of otherwise complicated data.

roadmap:

1. find yearly fire data, make time-series map color-coded => highlighting severity of fires and where they occur year-to-year 
2. find data measuring economic loss as a result of fires
3. zoom in on small communities devastated by fires
